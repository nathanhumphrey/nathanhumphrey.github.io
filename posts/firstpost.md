[nathanhumphrey.ca](https://nathanhumphrey.ca) will mark the third time I've tried to maintain an online written account of things that interest me. My previous attempts at blogging failed mostly due to two factors: my half-assed commitment to writing, and a large volume of higher-priority responsibilities (e.g. contract work, young children, completion of MBA, etc.). In short, I was spent.

This time around, my previous issues have mostly been resolved. Many of the extra life-happenings have slowed down or ended (e.g. MBA is complete, kids are growing up, contract work is not a priority). I've also made a personal commitment to writing for my own personal growth.

Wish me luck!
