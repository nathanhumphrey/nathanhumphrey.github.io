		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nathanhumphrey.ca/&quot;&gt;nathanhumphrey.ca&lt;/a&gt; will mark the third time I&#39;ve tried to maintain an online written account of things that interest me. My previous attempts at blogging failed mostly due to two factors: my half-assed commitment to writing, and a large volume of higher-priority responsibilities (e.g. contract work, young children, completion of MBA, etc.). In short, I was spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, my previous issues have mostly been resolved. Many of the extra life-happenings have slowed down or ended (e.g. MBA is complete, kids are growing up, contract work is not a priority). I&#39;ve also made a personal commitment to writing for my own personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
